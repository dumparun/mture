# MTURE - Angular Ionic boiler plate

MTURE is a project code name, and has nothing to do with code :). I dont know why developers are hooked up with code names, neverthless its fun. :D

> This is a boiler plate code base to enable you to jump start and build a project quickly, still enabling you with best practices for making the application scalable, maintainable and clean. 

# Why? 
The difference between a tutorial/hello world application and a real project is that, the latter would have a implementation of workflows, business cases, communication, security, exception handling, build mechanism, test cases and so on, while the former would only talk about these in bits and pieces. Based on how complex your project is, the above modules will keep varying. In most cases, the time spent by the team is to set up the project, finalize the pieces, doing POC, build scripts, figure out best pracitces and then putting up the puzzles together.

>This project is intented to put those missing pieces together as time goes on, add more and more best practices in places and present you with a boiler plate code, which can be used to build applications. This can be called as a bootstrap/bootloader to keep you running and work on business cases from day onw.

Now, there is another selfish interest behind this,

#What is in? 
Here i am trying to put up some flows together, which is used in general on most of the projects.

>In short, you will find code snippets, sometimes modules, which you can copy paste in

* A splash screen when the application starts
* A Login Screen which allows entry of user name and password.
* Validation of user name and password
* Server connection using REST JSON POST request to validate user name and password. (There is no real authentication, its dummy. any id and password will work)
* Home screen with a list of data. This was done to see how ionic scroll works and its pretty cool.
* On clicking any list, another screen with some action items
* To take a picture using camera - usage of camera plugin.
* A Ping Service
* A error service to show how to handle exceptions
* Translation to "Malayalam" language. This is my mother tounge, but you can use this to see how we implement localization/internationalization
* <b>Finally, a PHP server which exposes some REST services to show service integration</b>
