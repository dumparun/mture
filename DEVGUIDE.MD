gulp fullbuildandroid 
This command will remove existing android platform and then add new platform. While doing this all hooks will get executed. 
Also, after build completion, the APK will be copied on a release folder for easy deployment

gulp
Only converts sass to CSS

gulp buildandroid
same like fullbuildandroid, except that it will not remove the platform.
