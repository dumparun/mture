>If this piece of code, which mostly I have copy pasted from various sources, accidently (as i dont do anything intentionally) spills water on your keyboard, shows blue screen in windows, hangs your phone, destroys your data in your PC, informs your company about your bookmarks, shows your hidden files when you least expect it to, shows your porn history then dont blame me. Neither me or the code which i wrote is responsible for that. More seriously, if this program accidently kills you, hacks into governments data, makes you decide to marry, make you cry thinking about the decision, electrocutes your from battery shock, drowns you in 100 ml whiskey then dont blame me.

>On a serious note, this package uses certain libraries, frameworks which has its own licensing terms. Pleae follow those licensing information deligently and as usual please dont blame me for any consequences. You may need to hire a lawyer to understand those terms and conditions, and dont tell me, i did'nt told so.

Now, as far as my code goes, i follow the below licensing information

#####In essence, i dont care what you do with this, or how you use it. Neither i take profit from it nor loss.

>Now, if we meet, and you feel this is worth it, you may buy me a beer @ http://www.dumparun.info/dumparun/ </br>
If you feel otherwise that this is shit, you may tell me not to attempt this again after buying a beer @ http://www.dumparun.info/dumparun/
